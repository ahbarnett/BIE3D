Fortran codes by Tom Hagstrom for interpolation off a regular time grid, and
for timestepping, modified, matlab/MEX-wrapped, and tested by Alex Barnett.

A linux 64-bit MEX executable is shipped; run 'make' to compile a MEX interface
for your system.
Run 'make fdrivers' to compile and run all Tom's fortran drivers.
See Makefile for other options.

MATLAB drivers (Alex):
test_extrap.m : tiny demo of extrapolation
test_volterra.m : convergence tests for top-hat kernel 2nd-kind Volterra IE

Tom's codes:
dspline.f90 : fixed weights-filling codes
TestInterp.f90, TestInterpMat.f90 : test interp from values, and weights matrix
volterra.f90, volterrasolve.f90 : test 2nd-kind Volterra IE timestepping
SpecFunc.f90 : helper modules

Experts only:
gateway.mw : mwrap specification
Other .m files and gateway.c are auto-generated by mwrap
