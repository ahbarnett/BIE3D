# Time-domain integral-equation solver for 3D acoustic wave equation

This directory contains the implementation of the scheme
proposed in
A. H. Barnett, L. Greengard, T. Hagstrom,
"High-order discretization of a stable time-domain integral equation for 3D acoustic scattering" (2019).

See the ``paper`` directory for figure-generating codes.
